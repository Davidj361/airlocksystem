# airlocksystem
TO USE:

Put script in a Programmable Block, no timer needed. Should run once it's compiled. You can restart it via compiling as well.
Minimum blocks needed: 2 doors, 2 sensors, 1 vent

Name the block in the scheme [Airlock 1], the 2nd part is the ID of the Airlock.
You name the door or sensor as either [Airlock 1 In] or [Airlock 1 Out] depending if the sensor or door is on the outside side or the indoor side.
The name scheme is case sensitive and there may be other text outside as long as the scheme is valid.
The sensors activate the door to open and close, so adjust the sensors accordingly.
